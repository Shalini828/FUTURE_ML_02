# FUTURE_ML_02 — Support Ticket Classification System

This project is part of the Future Interns Machine Learning Track (Task 2).

## 📌 Project Goal
Build a system that automatically classifies customer support tickets and assigns priority levels.

## 🔹 Features Implemented
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Ticket category classification using Logistic Regression
- Rule-based priority assignment (High / Medium / Low)

## 🧠 Model Details
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Vectorization: TF-IDF
- Accuracy Achieved: ~20%

## 🚀 Outcome
The system predicts ticket categories such as Billing, Technical, Refund, etc., and assigns urgency levels to help support teams respond faster.

## 🛠 Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
