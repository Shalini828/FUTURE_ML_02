Default is 'lbfgs'.<br>To choose a solver, you might want to consider the following aspects:<br><br>- 'lbfgs' is a good default solver because it works reasonably well for a wide<br>  class of problems.<br>- For :term:`multiclass` problems (`n_classes >= 3`), all solvers except<br>  'liblinear' minimize the full multinomial loss, 'liblinear' will raise an<br>  error.<br>- 'newton-cholesky' is a good choice for<br>  `n_samples` >> `n_features * n_classes`, especially with one-hot encoded<br>  categorical features with rare categories. Be aware that the memory usage<br>  of this solver has a quadratic dependency on `n_features * n_classes`<br>  because it explicitly computes the full Hessian matrix.<br>- For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'<br>  and 'saga' are faster for large ones;<br>- 'liblinear' can only handle binary classification by default. To apply a<br>  one-versus-rest scheme for the multiclass setting one can wrap it with the<br>  :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`.<br><br>.. warning::<br>   The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen (`l1_ratio=0`<br>   for L2-penalty, `l1_ratio=1` for L1-penalty and `0 < l1_ratio < 1` for<br>   Elastic-Net) and on (multinomial) multiclass support:<br><br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   solver            l1_ratio                 multinomial multiclass<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   'lbfgs'           l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'liblinear'       l1_ratio=1 or l1_ratio=0 no<br>   'newton-cg'       l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'newton-cholesky' l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'sag'             l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'saga'            0<=l1_ratio<=1           yes<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br><br>.. note::<br>   'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features<br>   with approximately the same scale. You can preprocess the data with<br>   a scaler from :mod:`sklearn.preprocessing`.<br><br>.. seealso::<br>   Refer to the :ref:`User Guide <Logistic_regression>` for more<br>   information regarding :class:`LogisticRegression` and more specifically the<br>   :ref:`Table <logistic_regression_solvers>`<br>   summarizing solver/penalty supports.<br><br>.. versionadded:: 0.17<br>   Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG) descent solver.

    "# Support Ticket Classification System\n",
    "This project builds a machine learning system to automatically classify customer support tickets and assign priority levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Customer support teams receive many tickets daily. Manually categorizing them and deciding urgency is time-consuming.  \n",
    "This project uses NLP and Machine Learning to automate ticket classification and priority assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps Performed\n",
    "1. Data loading and exploration  \n",
    "2. Text cleaning and preprocessing  \n",
    "3. TF-IDF vectorization  \n",
    "4. Train-test split  \n",
    "5. Model training using Logistic Regression  \n",
    "6. Model evaluation  \n",
    "7. Rule-based priority assignment  \n",
    "8. Ticket prediction demo\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Details\n",
    "- Algorithm: Logistic Regression  \n",
    "- Text Vectorization: TF-IDF  \n",
    "- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "The model was able to classify support tickets into categories such as Billing, Technical, Refund, etc.  \n",
    "Accuracy achieved: 20.78% \n",
    "Although accuracy is moderate, the system demonstrates a complete NLP classification pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Priority Assignment Logic\n",
    "A rule-based system assigns ticket priority based on keywords:\n",
    "- High: refund, error, urgent, not working  \n",
    "- Medium: issue, problem, delay  \n",
    "- Low: general queries\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This project demonstrates how NLP and Machine Learning can automate support ticket classification and urgency detection, helping customer support teams respond more efficiently.\n"
